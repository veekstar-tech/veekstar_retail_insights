Prepared by: Victor Agina

1. Executive Summary

This report presents key insights into Veekstar Retail’s overall sales performance, advertising effectiveness, and customer behavior. The analysis highlights areas of strong growth, emerging challenges, and practical opportunities to increase revenue and profit across regions.
The findings show that Veekstar maintains a strong market presence, especially in the South-West region and through Billboard advertising, but faces regional performance gaps and margin pressures during peak seasons.

In summary:

The South-West region leads in both revenue and profit but also shows higher volatility.

Holiday seasons drive strong sales but not always proportional profit growth.

Customer loyalty and satisfaction are strong overall but have room for better conversion into repeat sales.

2. Regional Performance Overview

The South-West region generated approximately ₦2.53 billion, leading all other regions.

The North-West and South-East regions recorded lower revenues of ₦802 million and ₦991 million respectively.

Profit margins follow a similar pattern, suggesting that sales and marketing strategies are more effective in the South-West.

Recommendation:
Strengthen brand visibility and marketing in underperforming regions, especially the North-West and South-East, by tailoring campaigns to local needs and consumer behavior.

3. Advertising Channel Performance

Billboards remain the top performer with ₦1.59 billion in revenue, followed closely by Social Media at ₦1.56 billion.

Email and Radio campaigns show lower impact, with ₦1.33 billion and ₦1.40 billion respectively.

Recommendation:
Adjust marketing budgets to favor high-impact channels such as Billboards and Social Media. Introduce region-specific digital campaigns and influencer partnerships to maximize returns.

4. Product Category Insights

Electronics contribute the highest share of total sales (₦5.33 billion), showing strong demand for high-value products.

Fashion, Sports, and Toys perform moderately, while Groceries remain low due to smaller profit margins.

Recommendation:
Maintain focus on high-value products while introducing more promotions on mid-tier categories such as Fashion and Sports to stabilize cash flow and attract a wider customer base.

5. Revenue and Profit Trends

Monthly and quarterly reviews show a steady upward movement in both sales and profits, with sharp increases during November–December. However, profit margins tend to dip slightly during these months, indicating that heavy discounts and promotional spending may be reducing overall profitability.

Recommendation:
Balance promotional activities with cost control during holiday periods. Introduce “premium holiday offers” with bundled benefits instead of large discounts to sustain profitability.

6. Customer Demographics and Loyalty

The average customer age is around 38–39 years, slightly younger in the South-West region.

Customer satisfaction averages 4.0 out of 5, which is positive, but higher satisfaction does not yet translate strongly into higher spending.

Repeat customers show only a small difference in loyalty scores compared to one-time buyers.

Recommendation:
Enhance customer loyalty programs with tiered rewards and personalized follow-ups. Encourage repeat purchases through special offers and exclusive member benefits.

7. Key Business Drivers and Correlations

The analysis shows that Units Sold, Discount Applied, and Campaign Spend are the strongest predictors of revenue.
Loyalty and Satisfaction play a more indirect role, improving long-term retention rather than short-term sales.

Recommendation:
Focus on optimizing pricing strategies and advertising efficiency while continuing to build long-term customer trust and loyalty.
